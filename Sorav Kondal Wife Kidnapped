*Sorav Kondal Wife Kidnapped*

Certainly, here's the algorithm without any accompanying code:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Sorav starts his investigation in Dubai.
   - Sorav has an initial list of contacts in Dubai.
   - Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited contacts.

2. **Exploration:**
   - While there are contacts to explore:
     - Select the next contact from the list of contacts.
     - Communicate with the contact to gather information about the kidnapping.
     - If the contact provides new leads (additional people involved), add them to the list of contacts for further investigation.
     - Mark the current contact as visited to avoid revisiting.

3. **Termination:**
   - The investigation ends when:
     - Sorav has gathered sufficient information to solve the case, or
     - There are no more contacts left to explore.

This algorithm outlines the investigative process Sorav undertakes to gather information about the kidnapping by interacting with contacts and following leads provided by them.
