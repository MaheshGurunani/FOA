**Title: Soldier's Pathfinding Algorithm**

1. **Initialize:**
   - Prepare the soldier for the mission.
   - Create a 5x5 grid with random threat levels.

2. **Memoization Setup:**
   - Initialize a memoization table with large values.

3. **Start and End Points:**
   - Set start point: top-left corner.
   - Define end point: bottom-right corner.

4. **End Point Cost:**
   - Set cost at end point to zero.

5. **Update Memoization:**
   - Iterate through grid cells.
   - Calculate minimum cost to reach each cell.
   - Update memoization table with minimum cost.

6. **Pathfinding:**
   - Trace optimal path from end point to start.
   - Choose neighboring cell with minimum cost at each step.
   - Add cells to path until reaching start.

7. **Reverse Path:**
   - Reverse obtained path for start to end route.

8. **Display Path:**
   - Print optimal path for soldier to traverse.

9. **Calculate Total:**
   - Determine total terrorists eliminated along path.

10. **Mission Complete:**
    - Conclude mission, highlighting soldier's success in neutralizing threats.
    - Acknowledge soldier's bravery and strategy for ensuring peace.
